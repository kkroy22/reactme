      <P align="left">I did my engineering from Govind Ballabh Pant Engg. College, Ghurdauri. It is located in Garhwal region of Uttarakhand. The institute is located in serenity and purity of Garhwal Himalayas, at a height of 1800m (approx 5905 ft.) above the sea level. What is it like to be living in heaven? I think all GBPECians have an answer to this very question for they have spent their most beautiful 4 years of hostel life in natures lap. Studying in one of the premier Engineering Colleges of Uttarakhand was like having a long vacation on a hill station.</P>
